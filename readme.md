This is my first App that I'm publicly uploading to my GitHub. I've worked with other projects in the past, such as one in Android Studio, and another in Unity.

However, I never posted anything here in GitHub, so this is my first project being uploaded. This App was made as a Final Project for my graduation. I made this App as a
learning experience for React Native, as I never used React Native before and wanted to try it and compare it to other Mobile Development platforms like XCode, Android Studio or
Xamarin.
